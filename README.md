# Image Classification Using PyTorch with Data Augmentation

This project focuses on building an efficient image classification pipeline using **PyTorch**. It includes steps for **loading datasets**, **data augmentation**, **splitting datasets**, and **visualizing images**, laying a strong foundation for training deep learning models like CNNs or applying transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
